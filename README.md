# FAQ Accordion App

This is a simple FAQ accordion app built using **React.js** and **TypeScript**. The app allows users to view frequently asked questions (FAQ) and toggle answers to learn more. It’s designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to navigate through common questions.

## Features
- **Accordion functionality**: Click on a question to toggle its answer.
- **Dynamic data**: Each FAQ question and answer is passed via props, allowing for scalability and flexibility in handling different content.
- **Design**: The design is 90% complete, and the final touches are being worked on to ensure a clean and responsive interface.

## What I learned
- **Using Props**: Since the questions and answers were only differing by their content, I learned to use props effectively to pass data and make the code more concise and readable.
- **TypeScript**: Ensured type safety for props and state, improving the app's stability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the app structure and components.
- **TypeScript**: For ensuring type safety and clearer code.
- **CSS**: For styling the app’s layout and UI elements.

## Current Status
The app is almost complete, with a few final touches left on design and some minor adjustments to enhance the user experience. Once finalized, the app will provide a polished and fully functional FAQ accordion feature.
